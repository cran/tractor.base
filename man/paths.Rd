\usage{
relativePath(path, referencePath)

matchPaths(path, referencePath)

expandFileName(fileName, base = getwd())

ensureFileSuffix(fileName, suffix, strip = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{path, referencePath}{Character vectors whose elements represent file
paths.}

\item{fileName}{A character vector of file names.}

\item{base}{If \code{fileName} is a relative path, this option gives the
base directory which the path is relative to. If \code{fileName} is an
absolute path, this argument is ignored.}

\item{suffix}{A character vector of file suffixes, which will be recycled if
shorter than \code{fileName}.}

\item{strip}{A character vector of suffixes to remove before appending
\code{suffix}. The intended suffix does not need to be given here, as the
function will not append it if the specified file name already has the
correct suffix.}
}
\value{
The \code{ensureFileSuffix} function returns the specified file
  names with the requested suffixes appended. \code{expandFileName} returns
  the full path to the specified file name, collapsing \code{".."} elements
  if appropriate. \code{relativePath} returns the specified \code{path},
  expressed relative to \code{referencePath}. \code{matchPaths} resolves a
  a vector of paths against a vector of reference paths.
