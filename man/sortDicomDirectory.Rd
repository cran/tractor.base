\title{Sort a directory of DICOM files into series}
\description{
  This function sorts a directory containing DICOM files into subdirectories by series number, DICOM tag (0x0020,0x0011). Each unique series number, together with its description, DICOM tag (0x0008,0x103e), will be used as the name for a new subdirectory of the specified top-level directory, and all relevant files will be copied into that subdirectory. Duplicate file names are disambiguated if necessary.
}
\usage{
sortDicomDirectory(directory, deleteOriginals = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
  \item{directory}{A length-1 character vector giving the directory to search for DICOM files. Subdirectories will also be searched.}
  \item{deleteOriginals}{A single logical value. If \code{TRUE}, then the source files will be deleted after being copied to their new locations, making the operation a move rather than a copy. Nothing will be deleted if the copy fails.}
}
\value{
  This function is called for its side effect.
